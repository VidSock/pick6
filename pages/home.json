Each package contains food, hygiene, entertainment and handmade items, as well as personal letters of support. A Care Package brings joy to a Service Member stationed far from home or enables a Veteran to feel appreciated -- many for the first time. Our Care Packages for Wounded Heroes and Caregivers let them know that they are seen and that their great sacrifices for us are honored.”","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/index.md","sha":"686ee57437073325ed7480e2859f560a2acfd44a"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-02-02T21:49:06.562Z","version":"1"}
