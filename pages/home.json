Each package contains food, hygiene, entertainment and handmade items, as well as personal letters of support. A Care Package brings joy to a Service Member stationed far from home or enables a Veteran to feel appreciated -- many for the first time. Our Care Packages for Wounded Heroes and Caregivers let them know that they are seen and that their great sacrifices for us are honored.","version":"1","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/index.md","sha":"e69199d479abfa274d651e2cbe271fff4a9812cb"},"files":[]},"pr":{"number":7,"head":"93bfc6e5211b89fa6ad668077f0f7104f882cee9"},"timeStamp":"2020-02-05T16:00:49.460Z"}
