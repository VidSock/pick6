Each package contains food, hygiene, entertainment and handmade items, as well as personal letters of support. A Care Package brings joy to a Service Member stationed far from home or enables a Veteran to feel appreciated -- many for the first time. Our Care Packages for Wounded Heroes and Caregivers let them know that they are seen and that their great sacrifices for us are honored.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/index.md","sha":"dd9531f802baf296ff4ef322222b1a77885a5071"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-02-05T16:05:41.707Z","version":"1","status":"pending_publish"}
